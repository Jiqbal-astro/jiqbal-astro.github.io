  <p>
    Open clusters are among the most beautiful objects in the night sky — but they are also
    powerful astrophysical laboratories. During my graduate research, I explored the open clusters
    <strong>NGC 884</strong> and <strong>NGC 869</strong> in the constellation Perseus. These clusters,
    collectively known as the “Double Cluster,” offer a rare opportunity to study exoplanets in a young,
    coeval stellar population.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Observe Exoplanets in Open Clusters?</h2>
  <p>
    Most known exoplanets orbit field stars — stars that are not part of any cluster. While these discoveries
    are transformative, field stars come with uncertainties: they have different ages, metallicities, and stellar
    histories. Open clusters, by contrast, are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Same age</strong> (often 10–100 Myr)</li>
    <li><strong>Same chemical composition</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Same formation environment</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Different masses and evolutionary stages</strong></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This makes them ideal for studying how planetary systems form and evolve in a controlled astrophysical setting.
  </p>

  <h2>My Work on NGC 884 &amp; NGC 869</h2>
  <p>
    Using ground-based optical photometry from a 0.8 m telescope, I searched for short-period Jupiter-size planets
    (hot Jupiters). Although no exoplanet transit was found, the survey provided:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>High-precision light curves for cluster stars</li>
    <li>Detection of 25 variable stars</li>
    <li>Identification of 4 new variable candidates</li>
    <li>Constraints on the frequency of hot Jupiters in young clusters</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Even a <em>null detection</em> is scientifically powerful — it suggests that hot Jupiters may be rare or
    dynamically unstable in very young environments.
  </p>

  <h2>What These Results Mean</h2>
  <p>
    Many exoplanet discoveries suggest planetary migration occurs early in a system’s history. If hot Jupiters are
    absent in populations younger than ~30 Myr, this helps refine our models of planetary formation and orbital
    dynamics. Clusters like NGC 884 and NGC 869 can therefore serve as important tests for:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Disc migration timescales</li>
    <li>Planet–planet scattering</li>
    <li>Stellar UV radiation effects</li>
    <li>Mass loss from planetary atmospheres</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This work taught me that exoplanet science is not only about finding new planets — it is about understanding the
    <em>environments</em> in which they form. Open clusters remain one of the most promising, yet underexplored,
    environments for advancing that understanding.
